        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Here at Go To Zero our goal is to create positive change by educating consumers on environmentally friendly shopping.</p>
        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
          <p>The spark of hatred and vitriol burns bright in our hearts whenever we ponder upon large corporations. This intense malice was the seed that would sprout Go To Zero.</p>
